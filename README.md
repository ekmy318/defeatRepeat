## The Development

woreIt is a single page application that allows a user to upload pictures and keep track of their outfit through a one-to-many relationship. The user is able to sign up, sign in, change password and sign out. The post resource can be created, read, updated and destroyed.

As always, the best problem-strategy is to:
1. :question: Break down the problem to simple blocks - What specifically am I trying to achieve?
2. :books: Still stuck? Research previous issues.
3. :outbox_tray: Still stuck? Submit an issue to the instructional team.
4. :two_women_holding_hands: Still stuck? Talk with a fellow dev to a get different perspective.

Most importantly, follow the golden rule: :mega: **CONSOLE LOG EVERYTHING.** :mega:
